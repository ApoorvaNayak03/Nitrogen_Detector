# Leaf_categoriser
This Flutter project serves as a mobile tool for nitrogen content detection in leaf images. Leveraging the device's camera, users can capture images of leaves, enabling the app to perform an analysis and estimate nitrogen levels within the foliage. The main screen showcases the captured images, while tapping on a specific image opens a full-screen view presenting detailed nitrogen category information associated with that particular leaf. This application provides an intuitive and accessible platform for users to assess and categorize nitrogen content in leaves, facilitating efficient and portable monitoring of plant health.
